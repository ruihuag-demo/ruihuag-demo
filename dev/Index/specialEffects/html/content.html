    <p> We shall start this with a quote from Sir Tim Berners-Lee,
        <q cite="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Internet">
            I was lucky enough to invent the Web at the time when the Internet already existed - and had for a decade
            and a half.</q> We must understand that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with building on the
            contributions of others.
        </p>
        
    <h1>6</h1>
        <h2>232323</h2>
        <h2>232323</h2>
    <p> Here we shall quote the Mozilla Manifesto,
        <q cite="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">
            Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.</q> And
        so, we can infer that contributing to the open web, can protect our own individual experiences on it.
    </p>

    <p><q>This is a <q>big</q> quote.</q></p>
