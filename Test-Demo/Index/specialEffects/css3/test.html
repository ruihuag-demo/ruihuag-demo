            　1 In the house where I grew up， it was our custom to leave the front door on the latch at night。
            I don't know if that was a local term or if it is universal; "on the latch" meant the door was
            closed but not locked。 None of us carried keys; the last one in for the evening would close up，
            and that was it。<br />
    
            　　
            小时候在家里，我们的前门总是夜不落锁。我不知道这是当地的一种说法还是大家都这么说；"不落锁"的意思是掩上门，但不锁住。我们谁都不带钥匙；晚上最后一个回家的人把门关上，这就行了。<br />
    
            　　2 Those days are over。 In rural areas as well as in cities， doors do not stay unlocked， even
            for part of an evening。<br />
    
            　　 那样的日子已经一去不复返了。在乡下，在城里，门不再关着不锁上，哪怕是傍晚一段时间也不例外。<br />
    
            　　3 Suburbs and country areas are， in many ways， even more vulnerable than well-patroled urban
            streets。 Statistics show the crime rate rising more dramatically in those allegedly tranquil
            areas than in cities。 At any rate， the era of leaving the front door on the latch is over。<br />
    
            　　 在许多方面，郊区和农村甚至比巡查严密的城市街道更易受到攻击。统计显示，那些据称是安宁的地区的犯罪率上升得比城镇更为显著。不管怎么说，前门虚掩不落锁的时代是一去不复返了。<br />
    
            　　4 It has been replaced by dead-bolt locks， security chains， electronic alarm systems and trip
            wires hooked up to a police station or private guard firm。 Many suburban families have sliding
            glass doors on their patios， with steel bars elegantly built in so no one can pry the doors
            open。<br />
    
            　　 取而代之的是防盗锁、防护链、电子报警系统，以及连接警署或私人保安公司的报警装置。郊区的许多人家在露台上安装了玻璃滑门，内侧有装得很讲究的钢条，这样就没人能把门撬开。<br />
    
            　　5 It is not uncommon， in the most pleasant of homes， to see pasted on the windows small
            notices announcing that the premises are under surveillance by this security force or that guard
            company。 在最温馨的居家，也常常看得到窗上贴着小小的告示，称本宅由某家安全机构或某个保安公司负责监管。<br />
    
            　　6 The lock is the new symbol of America。 Indeed， a recent public-service advertisement by a
            large insurance company featured not charts showing how much at risk we are， but a picture of a
            child's bicycle with the now-usual padlock attached to it。<br />
    
            　　 锁成了美国的新的象征。的确，一家大保险公司最近的一则公益广告没有用图表表明我们所处的危险有多大，而是用了一幅童车的图片，车身上悬着如今无所不在的挂锁。<br />
    
            　　7 The ad pointed out that， yes， it is the insurance companies that pay for stolen goods， but
            who is going to pay for what the new atmosphere of distrust and fear is doing to our way of
            life？ Who is going to make the psychic payment for the transformation of America from the Land
            of the Free to the Land of the Lock？<br />
    
            　　 广告指出，没错，确是保险公司理赔失窃物品，但谁来赔偿互不信任、担心害怕这种新氛围对我们的生活方式所造成的影响呢？谁来对美国从自由之国到锁之国这一蜕变作出精神赔偿呢？<br />

            I don't know if that was a local term or if it is universal; "on the latch" meant the door was
            closed but not locked。 None of us carried keys; the last one in for the evening would close up，
            and that was it。<br />
    
            　　
            小时候在家里，我们的前门总是夜不落锁。我不知道这是当地的一种说法还是大家都这么说；"不落锁"的意思是掩上门，但不锁住。我们谁都不带钥匙；晚上最后一个回家的人把门关上，这就行了。<br />
    
            　　2 Those days are over。 In rural areas as well as in cities， doors do not stay unlocked， even
            for part of an evening。<br />
    
            　　 那样的日子已经一去不复返了。在乡下，在城里，门不再关着不锁上，哪怕是傍晚一段时间也不例外。<br />
    
            　　3 Suburbs and country areas are， in many ways， even more vulnerable than well-patroled urban
            streets。 Statistics show the crime rate rising more dramatically in those allegedly tranquil
            areas than in cities。 At any rate， the era of leaving the front door on the latch is over。<br />
    
            　　 在许多方面，郊区和农村甚至比巡查严密的城市街道更易受到攻击。统计显示，那些据称是安宁的地区的犯罪率上升得比城镇更为显著。不管怎么说，前门虚掩不落锁的时代是一去不复返了。<br />
    
            　　4 It has been replaced by dead-bolt locks， security chains， electronic alarm systems and trip
            wires hooked up to a police station or private guard firm。 Many suburban families have sliding
            glass doors on their patios， with steel bars elegantly built in so no one can pry the doors
            open。<br />
    
            　　 取而代之的是防盗锁、防护链、电子报警系统，以及连接警署或私人保安公司的报警装置。郊区的许多人家在露台上安装了玻璃滑门，内侧有装得很讲究的钢条，这样就没人能把门撬开。<br />
    
            　　5 It is not uncommon， in the most pleasant of homes， to see pasted on the windows small
            notices announcing that the premises are under surveillance by this security force or that guard
            company。 在最温馨的居家，也常常看得到窗上贴着小小的告示，称本宅由某家安全机构或某个保安公司负责监管。<br />
    
            　　6 The lock is the new symbol of America。 Indeed， a recent public-service advertisement by a
            large insurance company featured not charts showing how much at risk we are， but a picture of a
            child's bicycle with the now-usual padlock attached to it。<br />
    
            　　 锁成了美国的新的象征。的确，一家大保险公司最近的一则公益广告没有用图表表明我们所处的危险有多大，而是用了一幅童车的图片，车身上悬着如今无所不在的挂锁。<br />
    
            　　7 The ad pointed out that， yes， it is the insurance companies that pay for stolen goods， but
            who is going to pay for what the new atmosphere of distrust and fear is doing to our way of
            life？ Who is going to make the psychic payment for the transformation of America from the Land
            of the Free to the Land of the Lock？<br />
    
            　　 广告指出，没错，确是保险公司理赔失窃物品，但谁来赔偿互不信任、担心害怕这种新氛围对我们的生活方式所造成的影响呢？谁来对美国从自由之国到锁之国这一蜕变作出精神赔偿呢？<br />
